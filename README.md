# ETH-AVAX-Module2

I've integrated a `Smart Contract` with the `Front-End Application` in this project.

### Description

In this contract, the functionality of the basic ATM is implemented. Where users can `Deposit` and `WithDraw` the `ETH Tokens`. Also, users can check their balance by connecting their `Metamask` wallet with the app.

### How to Run?

To run this project you have to follow specific steps:-
  - Inside the project directory, type `npm i` in the terminal.
  - Open the second terminal, and enter `npx hardhat node`.  (This will initiate hardhat)
  - Open the third terminal and type, `npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js`. (This will deploy the contract)
NOTE: Do the steps in order.

### Tech Used

For Front-End part: `ReactJS`, `NextJS`.
For Contract: `Solidity`
